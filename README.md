# Planet Introduction

【Everyone is a Pythonista】

Focus on the Python field and be the most professional Python planet.

Xingzhu is the TechLead of the top four consulting companies, and is currently the winner of mongoDB Professional in the field of entrepreneurial big data.

[Learn Python from scratch]

Provides how to use the compiler, basic syntax, functions, decorators, object-oriented, etc.

The top post "Resource Post" contains the most complete Python zero-based brain map on the entire network.

The content is expressed in the form of articles, and each article has after-class exercises. Students who submit homework will have a special person responsible for marking and giving comments.

【Practical project】

When you successfully come from zero foundation or want to get started directly, we provide the second stage of practical training.

The training includes well-designed iterative projects, as well as production projects and excellent projects on github.

There will be a warm-up session to start the project, and the number of applicants is strictly controlled. Those who have not registered can still submit their homework, but they will not be corrected. The implication is that you can listen in.

The training can be developed independently or collaboratively. Strictly divided according to grades, only those who pass the first project can enter the next project training.

【Great voyage】

Different from practical training, the whole training project will be discussed publicly in the form of articles, and the development process will be recorded. Dahanghai adopts the method of live voice broadcast, and the content will also be the only certification on the whole network.

The project is a self-made game client.

The project consists of a server and a client. The server has been developed by Xingzhu and his friends, and the function version will be iterated continuously. Golfers need to make their own client.

By continuously improving the logic of the client to win the game, members of the previous period can also participate in the new period, but there will be quota restrictions and role switching.

【Technical Salon】

We will organize online technical salon activities from time to time, aiming to strengthen the interaction and technical exchange of golfers.

The topic will be announced in advance in the salon event, and golfers participating in the technical salon need to bring at least one argument to participate.

【Internal referral channel】

This is a benefit provided by Star Lord. If you pass the assessment of most items and can defeat Star Lord's primary client in the great voyage, then you can get an internal referral opportunity。
